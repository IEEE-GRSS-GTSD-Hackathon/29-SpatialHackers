STEPS FOLLOWED/
•	Made LULC map of 2022 and 2016 to understand change
•	Made soil map of Uttarakhand
•	Made landslide density heatmap of Chamoli landslide, 2022
•	Made landslide susceptibility map of Chamoli, Uttarakhand, 2022 
The change in LULC led to more disasters. Disaster management involves promoting sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss along with preparedness.
